Interview Question
Would you minify files for development or production? Why?

Your reflection
Production.
Things to think about
Some interview questions will feel deceptively easy. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the question has an unexpected answer. With a question like this, the interviewer really wants to know that you understand the concepts and differences between development and production. In this question, you can answer by simply saying “production”, but you would be missing out. The “why” part is your big opportunity to show just how much you know about the subject. Even if the interviewer does not add the “why” at the end in person. Pretend it’s there. Take every opportunity to show your grasp of important concepts.
