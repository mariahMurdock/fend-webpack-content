Interview Question
At work, a project requires the use of a technology that is completely new to you. What steps would you take to learn the required technology?

Your reflection
I would take these steps:

1. Look up a course on Udacity, Github, or Udemy.
2. Download a book and dedicate an hr a day to reading book.
3. Record progress and set a deadline.
4. Consult boss on progress weekly.
Things to think about
I came across these types of questions fairly often while interviewing. Companies want to understand your process, and they really want to know that you are confident and capable of picking up new languages quickly. Most importantly with questions like this, show that you have a process for learning and let your hard work learning code shine to highlight just how quickly you pick up these topics.
